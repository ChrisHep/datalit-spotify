# Data Literacy Project WS 2021-2022

We are planning to use the collection of [1.2 million spotify songs](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs) which contains
numerous information about the songs’ features. We are interested in the devel-
opment of songs’ features **over time**. For example, we want to analyze whether
there is a difference between a songs’ duration before 2000 and after 2000. We are
planning to apply interferential statistics methods on the data and potentially linear
regression.
